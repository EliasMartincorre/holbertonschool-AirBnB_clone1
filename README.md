# What is The Console?
The AirBnB console is the first part of the major project of the second trimester, a command interpreter for said project that allows to manipulate objects related to the clone itself.
**The console is a key part of the project, and all subsequent parts depend on it.**

#  What are its main uses?
- Create new objects of the classes.
- Retrieve said objects.
- Do operations on those objects, like counting, computing stats, etc.
- Update said objects when necessary.
- Destroy those objects.

# How do I use it?



First, download it into your computer by cloning [this](https://github.com/EliasMartincorre/holbertonschool-AirBnB_clone) repository and then typing ./console.py to initialize its interactive mode.

 You can exit the console by typing the <code>quit</code> command on the console, or with any EOF.
# What can I do with it?
There's a variety of uses for the console right as it it right now, and next you can learn them.

## Create

By using that command, you can create your own object with its personal ID as shown on screen (which you will use forwards).

## Update

Update, as you can see there, allows to update and even add new attributes to the object that you created by using its ID and the new data you want to add.

## Destroy

As you can see there, destroy does exactly what it says, allowing oneself to delete a class once it is not needed anymore. You need the ID and type of the class, as seen.   
<br>

<br>

## Show

It's fairly simple. As seen, you can use show to see the string representation of a created object, with all its attributes. You only need the ID, and the type of the class.
 <br>

</br>
 
## All

Working fairly similar to the `show` command, all shows on screen all string representations of created objects. If you don't give it anything else, it prints every created object. But if you give it a type of object, it prints all representations of that object.
